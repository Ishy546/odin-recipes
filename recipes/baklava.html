        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Phyllo dough</li>
            <li>Nuts</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Cinnamon</li>
            <li>Water, sugar, vanilla, honey</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Toss together nuts and cinnamon. Unroll phyllo and cut the whole stack in half to fit the dish. Cover phyllo with a damp cloth while assembling the baklava, to keep it from drying out.</li>
            <li>Place 2 sheets of phyllo in the bottom of the prepared dish. Brush generously with some of the melted butter. Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons of the nut mixture on top. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used, ending with about 6 sheets of phyllo.</li>
            <li>Using a sharp knife, cut baklava into 4 long rows, then diagonally 9 times to make 36 diamond shapes. Be sure to cut all the way through to the bottom of the layers.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and crisp, about 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>While baklava is baking, combine sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Stir in honey, vanilla, and lemon zest; reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove baklava from the oven and immediately spoon syrup over it. Let cool completely before serving. Store uncovered.</li>
        </ol>
